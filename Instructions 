This is the instructions to set up the Raspberry pi and the breadboard to get an led to blink and all that from this code 
Things used 
	Node 		- Main language 
	Ajax		- Making a on click call
	Express		- Doing the web server
	on off		- Controlling the LEDs 
	

Step One  Download all files from github 
		> index.html	- This is your web page 
		> blink.js 	- This is the node server and all that 
		> wPageClient.js- This is where the web page controls are and all that like click
		> node_modules 	- This is all that packages you need and all that fun stuff 
		> package.json 	- This is the manifest for the project you need this to let node knwo what stuff you are using 

Step Two Hook the wires up You will need an LED , resistor and three pieces of wire 
	(Red)One wire to end of LED and the other end of that wire to pin 7 (Right row (the one closest to HDMI) forth from bottom(bottom is from the SD card))
	(Yellow)The other wire goes to your resistor and the resistor goes to the led 
	(Yellow)The other wire goes to the ground pin which is pin 6 (Left row (the one farthest to HDMI) second from bottom(bottom is from the SD card))

Step Three Open terminal and go to the folder that holds this code 
	EX cd /home/pi/blinkLEDNode

Step Four Open terminal and run the program
	EX node blink.js
	you should be able to told the port it was running on

Step Five Using it 	
	Get the Pi's Ip and type it into another pcs address bar (The other pc needs to be on same network) with the port it tells you to after 
	EX 192.168.11.23:3000

Step Six Click the button
	Should change state of button!
